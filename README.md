# FuturismTwitterAngularApp


1. I'm using Twitter's APIs to finish an independent self-study student project. I am learning to code and wish to use the API to work with the Angular app I'm creating to allow the user to access 10 tweets from different Futurists.
2. My solution will *not* analyze tweets, Twitter users, or liking their content. I will be using the Twitter API to feed 10 tweets from 5 specific Twitter users into my Angular app.
3. My solution will *not* involve Tweeting, Retweeting, or liking content. It will also *not* interact with Twitter users or their content.
4. Twitter data will be displayed to my users via the Angular App in the form of 10 Tweets related to Futurism from 5 specific Twitter users I will be following. The 10 tweets will be posted together on 1 page of my app (of the 3 total pages). Another page (of the 3 pages) will post 1 random tweet from the 10 aforementioned tweets. I am creating this as a student project. In will be posting my Angular app on my portfolio site, leonaponce.com.
